## Setup Instructions

### API Key Configuration
1. Copy `appsettings.template.json` to a new file named `appsettings.json`
2. Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Hugging Face API key
3. Make sure never to commit your actual `appsettings.json` file to the repository

```bash
# Copy the template
cp appsettings.template.json appsettings.json

# Edit appsettings.json and add your API key
```

The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent committing sensitive information like API keys.
